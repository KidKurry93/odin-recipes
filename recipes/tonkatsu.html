        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut the edge of the pork chops in several places. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with 3 shallow dishes. Place flour in the first dish, lightly beaten egg in the second dish, and panko breadcrumbs in the third dish.</li>
        <li>Coat each pork chop generously with flour, shaking any excess off.</li>
        <li>Coat pork with panko breadcrumbs and set aside on a platter.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan, heat the canola oil to around 340 F as measured on a frying thermometer.</li>
        <li>Deep-fry breaded pork for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn pork over and fry about 5 more minutes or until cooked through and browned.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>While pork is resting, finely shred green cabbage and soak in ice-cold water.</li>
        <li>Drain shredded cabbage well.</li>
        <li>Cut each tonkatsu lengthwise into small pieces and serve on plates with a side of the shredded cabbage. Drizzle some of the tonkatsu sauce over tonkatsu before eating. Serve karashi (hot Japanese mustard) on the side if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
